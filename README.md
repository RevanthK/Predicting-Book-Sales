Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rihNKkjyEM3ba70oaaxcJcwOEzb9WPek-jZ_wyB-MgI/edit?usp=sharing

## Background

- $43 billion book industry
- 2.7 billion books sold in the United States every year
- Only 4000 new titles sold more than 1000 copies/year
- But 45,000 authors in the US market
    - Takeaway: Most authors struggle to get published, a few of them like J.K. Rowling earn hundreds of millions of dollars from their books

## Task

Predict sales of books using only variables available before the actual publication date
- Ex: book’s author, topic and publisher

Poses an important and lucrative problem for publishers and authors
